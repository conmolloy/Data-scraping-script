# Data scraping script

This is a Python 2.7 example of collecting data from a website that dosnt have a clean html structure.
It may not be the most efficient script but it does work if you want to run the exe to prove it.(the Data file will be added to the  top level directory)
This was a difficult job but once it was finnished it hasnt broke once in so far a year.
